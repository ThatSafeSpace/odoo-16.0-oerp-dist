The now sanctioned country will be highlighted in red.
Same functionality is implemented for "Fed. States"

### Result:
If a contact is located in a sanctioned country or state,
they will be filtered out when selecting a Partner for a Sale Order.

This ensures that no sales can happen with partners from sanctioned countries or regions.
